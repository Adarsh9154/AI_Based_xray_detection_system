##  Features

- **Pre-trained Model:** Includes a `best_model.h5` trained on radiographic data for fracture detection.
- **Web App Interface:** Run `app.py` to launch a user-friendly interface—upload an image and receive instant predictions.
- **Jupyter Notebook Demo:** Explore model performance, sample predictions, and data analysis with `demo01.ipynb`.
- **Easy Setup:** All dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` for smooth environment setup.
- **Customizable:** Swap in your own model or extend the interface based on your needs.
